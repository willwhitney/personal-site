I'm Will Whitney, a PhD student working with Rob Fergus at NYU. Before this I worked with Josh Tenenbaum at MIT for my Master's, and before that I was a very unsuccessful entrepreneur.

Anything I write here is wild speculation and (obviously) doesn't reflect the views of the much wiser people that I work with.
