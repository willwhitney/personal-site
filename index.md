![me in lab](assets/img/in_lab.jpg)

I'm Will Whitney, a PhD student working with Kyunghyun Cho at NYU. Before this I worked with Josh Tenenbaum and Tejas Kulkarni at MIT for my Master's. In a past life I started a company and went through Y Combinator. I'm also the creator of [Hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen), an interactive coding environment for the Atom text editor, which has been downloaded >2,000,000 times.

## Research interests
Currently I'm working on representation learning and reinforcement learning for continuous control. Previously I worked on generative models with interpretable latent spaces.

My interests include the inductive biases of neural networks, learned structure in latent spaces, and robotics. Most recently I've become very interested in questions of sample complexity and expressivity: what makes a function easy or hard to approximate with a neural network?
